Moveaid a web service 
that helps to organize free transportation to medical clinics and other points of interest in the city
of Bozen, inspired from an existing service that needs digitization. 
It uses an MVC framework (back-end) and CSR front-end with a RESTful
		API middle-ware. The service interacts with
Openstreetmap's Nominatim API and a custom message daemon that sends SMS via a CSM module. 
Docker and a CI were used to orchestrate.
Financed by ADA + LugBZ that covered R\&D expenses (web-hosting and a GSM module). 
[Here the presentation of the project](https://www.sfscon.it/talks/moveaid-a-web-app-to-foster-accessible-mobility/), the [part of the project I principally contributed](https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/red-giant/dashboard) 
and the [ongoing development of the team](https://gitlab.com/lugbz/moveaid).

[Jubble](https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/jubble/prpr_project_jubble) is an idle game
inspired from [A. Pecorella](https://blog.kongregate.com/the-math-of-idle-games-part-i/) 
articles which uses the concepts of derivative to generate game currency.
It's based on a MVC core that keeps the core functionality separated from
		the two clients: a JavaFX UI and a
Telegram bot which simultaneously interact with the core. 
The project is a sandbox to practice Java techniques and writing clean code,
providing the highest coverage of testing and documentation as possible, with
better use to version control. 

## Older projects 
[Calor](https://github.com/calorifero/app), a smart thermometer using a IoT sensor that helps the energy provider Regas to spot energy consumption patterns in customer’s houses.
The project was developed for an Espressif ESP-32 equipped with a thermometer. This
		control unit
		collects and sends data to a server to provide an analysis of the energy
		consumption, knowledge that will be reused to provide energy saving advises
		to users. 
Financed by Regas + Adecco that purchased the
 micro-controller and the sensors.
 We were one backend-developer, a 3D modeler and me as mobile developer, 
	 project manager and IoT developer.
 The project was incomplete due the COVID pandemic, 
	 but made possible to understand the limitation of edge devices.

[Crespi](https://github.com/visionn/crespi) a 3D virtual reality experience of a UNESCO using WebGL.
- React app using Three.js that makes possible to interact
		with 3D models.
- Financed by PON founds of the European Union cover a 360° cam and 
		commuting expenses.
- Done by my classroom, where I coordinated the teams and worked as a 
		React developer.
- Won 1st prize of I.S Archimede Project day (my high school) in 2019
