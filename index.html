<p>Moveaid a web service that helps to organize free transportation to
medical clinics and other points of interest in the city of Bozen,
inspired from an existing service that needs digitization. It uses an
MVC framework (back-end) and CSR front-end with a RESTful API
middle-ware. The service interacts with Openstreetmap’s Nominatim API
and a custom message daemon that sends SMS via a CSM module. Docker and
a CI were used to orchestrate. Financed by ADA + LugBZ that covered
R&amp;D expenses (web-hosting and a GSM module). <a

is an idle game inspired from <a
href="https://blog.kongregate.com/the-math-of-idle-games-part-i/">A.
Pecorella</a> articles which uses the concepts of derivative to generate
game currency. It’s based on a MVC core that keeps the core
functionality separated from the two clients: a JavaFX UI and a Telegram
bot which simultaneously interact with the core. The project is a
sandbox to practice Java techniques and writing clean code, providing
the highest coverage of testing and documentation as possible, with
better use to version control.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/calorifero/app">Calor</a>, a smart
thermometer using a IoT sensor that helps the energy provider Regas to
spot energy consumption patterns in customer’s houses. The project was
developed for an Espressif ESP-32 equipped with a thermometer. This
control unit collects and sends data to a server to provide an analysis
of the energy consumption, knowledge that will be reused to provide
energy saving advises to users. Financed by Regas + Adecco that
purchased the micro-controller and the sensors. We were one
backend-developer, a 3D modeler and me as mobile developer, project
manager and IoT developer. The project was incomplete due the COVID
pandemic, but made possible to understand the limitation of edge
devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/visionn/crespi">Crespi</a> a 3D virtual
reality experience of a UNESCO using WebGL. - React app using Three.js
that makes possible to interact with 3D models. - Financed by PON founds
of the European Union cover a 360° cam and commuting expenses. - Done by
my classroom, where I coordinated the teams and worked as a React
developer. - Won 1st prize of I.S Archimede Project day (my high school)
in 2019</p>
